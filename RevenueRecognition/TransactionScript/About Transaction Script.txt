Transaction Script

How it Works

- Organize domain logic by the transactions that you carry out in the system
- Separate Transaction Scripts as much as you can from e.g. presentation and data source
- Either place multiple Transaction Scripts in a single class, where each class defines a subject area,
  or have each Transaction Script in its own class, using the Command pattern.
- The term Transaction Script is used because most of the time you'll have one Transaction Script per
  database transaction.

When to Use It

- The glory of Transaction Script is its simplicity
- Natural for applications with only a small amount of logic
- Very little overhead either in performance or understanding
- For more complicated business logic, it gets harder to keep in well-designed state
- A problem to watch out for is duplication between transactions
- More complex business domains should use Domain Model instead
- There's a lot of simple problems out there, and a simple solution will get you up and running much faster
